<p><strong>Explain why a nucleus has zero dipole moment. what
information does the measurement of the electric quadrupole moment of
nucleus provides?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>A dipole moment is created when a separation exists between
positive and negative charges in a system.</p>
<p>The formula for dipole moment, where <span
class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> is the charge magnitude and the
<span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the charge separation
distance: <span
class="math display"><em>μ</em> = <em>Q</em> × <em>r</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>A stable nucleus does not have a separation of charges. Instead
their distributions of mass and charge are spherically
symmetric.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that the centre of mass and charge of coincide at the
center of the atom. This results in there being zero dipole
moment.</p></li>
<li><p>A deformation of the electric quadrupole moment of an atom shows
us how much its nuclear charge distribution deviates from a perfect
sphere.</p></li>
<li><p>A positive EQM indicates an elongation of the charge distribution
along its axis of spin. A negative EQM indicates a flattening of the
charge distribution along the axis of spin.</p></li>
<li><p>The character of the EQM can be used to test nuclear models. The
shell model predicts that nuclei with a “magic numbers” of nucleons
should be spherically symmetric and so should have near-zero quadrupole
moments.</p></li>
<li><p>The quadrupole hyperfine structure occurs due to the the nuclear
EQM interacting with the <em>electric field gradient</em> created by the
surrounding electrons in atoms, ions and molecules.</p></li>
